If there is no restriction at the end, the pressure there approaches zero, and the flow through the pipe will then be determined solely by the friction of the pipe. Yes, as the flow decreases, the friction and therefore the reduction in pressure decreases; if the end is completely blocked, the pressure becomes constant over the whole length of the hose as being the pressure in the water mains.

Pinhole opening, tiny spray at highest velocity, which can immediately turn into a mist. Very little water.

In the completely inviscid case, it would decrease by an even larger factor.  Considering the inviscid case is also an easy way to demonstrate that Abd's claim about the unimportance of friction is incorrect.  Assuming a given source pressure, for inviscid flow the velocity at the outlet will be the same regardless of the size of the opening--it will be just fast enough to squirt straight up to a height matching the pressure head (thumb will not make it squirt farther).  So, here is the deal: friction is NOT the main reason that flow decreases when you apply your thumb;  but it IS what causes the pressure drop along the hose, so when you slow the flow with your thumb, reducing the frictional losses in the pipes/hose, the pressure just behind your thumb is greater.

So the pressure does not decline along the hose, as Rracecarr claimed; rather, with an open hose, or with any constriction at the end, the pressure along the hose is constant; the changes in pressure only take place at places of constriction, where pressure decreases as speed increases. If the hose is open at the end, the pressure in the hose is essentially zero, assuming the hose is level, and it is zero all the way back to the faucet.\n", "(Because water is not perfectly free of viscosity, this isn't absolutely true, but for practical purposes, it is.)\n", "While it is true that, when we constrict the output of a hose, as with a thumb, the pressure increases, when we look at the steady state with a given outlet size, the water is not flowing faster in the hose itself, indeed, it is flowing slower. But then it is quite reasonable to understand what is happening at the outlet is that this same flow (i.e., the same as is flowing into the hose and as is flowing out of it) is \"squeezed\" through a smaller opening, and therefore must travel faster. Thus the supposed \"popular conception\" is not wrong, though it is incomplete, it does not address the reduction in flow rate and increase in pressure inside the hose which goes together with the increase in speed at the hose opening. The increase in pressure is caused by the water being \"squeezed\" through a smaller opening!\n", "The increase in pressure can also be understood as being caused by a lessening of the pressure drop across the faucet feeding the hose (mostly), due to decreased flow. The flow does not decrease from \"friction,\" not with an inviscid liquid like water, but from pure reduction in the channel size with a constant pressure. Rracecarr was correct that with constant pressure behind an opening, the speed of water leaving the opening does not vary with opening size. But the total flow rate varies directly with the pressure and the size of the opening, and the flow rate affects the pressure loss at the faucet, and the resulting increase in pressure can approach the full system pressure as the flow approaches zero. I'm still not satisfied with this explanation.\n", "When I put my thumb over the end of the hose, I can feel the squeezing, in fact. It really does feel like I've got an incompressible liquid, as I do, and, in fact, if there were no water source, no water pressure, and under certain conditions, I could get the water to squirt about as far with the same thumb pressure. Because the system would be losing water, I'd have to have the squeezing be arranged to be able to move, but it's not a bad way to think about this, that the thumb is squeezing water out of the hose or \"squeezing it through a smaller opening.\" The thumb pressure increases the water pressure at the same time as it reduces the opening size. (The water pressure cannot exceed the pressure applied by the thumb!) \n", "Bottom line: the article was incorrect, friction is not the explanation at all. --", " (", ") 23:33, 15 May 2009 (UTC)", "\n", "\n", "Above, friction was repeatedly proposed as an explanation for the commonly-observed increase in pressure when flow is reduced in a hose, i.e., that when the flow rate decreases, loss of pressure due to friction was reduced. It was claimed that pressure in a hose that is open at the end is reduced from source pressure (pressure at the faucet in this case) to zero at the end. To test the hypothesis that frictional loss of pressure was proportional to flow rate, I conceived of a thought experiment: measure the flow rate through a hose that is one length (25 feet), then measure the flow rate when no other parameters are changed except that the hose is doubled in length by coupling an additional hose section. I claimed that the flow rate would not change, whereas if frictional losses would reduce the pressure to zero at a given flow rate over the length of the original hose, there would then be no pressure for the additional length of hose; but this argument would apply to any length of hose as the original and therefore the pressure would be zero over any length of hose. The thought experiment wasn't adequate, apparently, to convince those arguing for friction with complex equations. So, yesterday morning, needing to use a hose on a lawn, I tested the idea. I connected a 25 foot length of hose to a faucet and adjusted the faucet to what seemed to be roughly half of full force. I measured the time to fill a bucket that was approximately 5 gallon capacity, it was 101 seconds. I then coupled an additional 25 feet of hose on, and measured the fill time. It was 100 seconds, which is within time measurement error. (In addition, when I was filling the bucket the first time, for part of the fill, about half, I had the hose end elevated by the bucket height, which would slightly slow the fill rate because of gravity differential; for the remainder of the time and for the second run, the hose end was kept at the bottom of the bucket.)\n", "Adding length of hose does not significantly reduce the flow rate and therefore friction with the hose is a negligible effect. \n", "My prediction is that the hose could be made any length and that flow rate would not be reduced, that the only restriction on flow is that produced by a constriction in the line, which is not a frictional effect, but simply a reflection of the fact that flow of a non-viscous liquid through an opening is proportional to source pressure and the cross-sectional area of the opening (if turbulence can be neglected), and that water, on this scale, behaves non-viscously. Hence a flow through an open hose is generally determined by the faucet setting, if this is the tightest constriction in the line. Putting the thumb over the end of the hose moves the tightest constriction to the end of the hose, shifting the point of pressure loss to that location, the pressure loss at the faucet moves toward zero. Communication of pressure through a full hose, if we neglect the elasticity of the hose, moves at the speed of sound in the water, so pressure increases immediately at the hose end, causing the squirting seen. I was unable to stop the flow at the end with my thumb, getting myself quite wet through trying; I could not assert full system pressure with my thumb, which is what would have been required.\n", "(There is also obviously some pressure, possibly transient, involved in coupling a new length of hose, at the junction with the old hose, because that, as well, squirted water as I added the hose. I had to add it \"live, \" with water flowing, because I didn't want to change the faucet setting. I really did get quite soaked. I do not pretend to understand this phenomenon.)\n", "This is, of course, ", ", and is useful only for background, and as an object lesson. What is above as analysis of the situation, by editors apparently competent with math and basic physics, is also original research, and, though asserted with great confidence, was dead wrong.

When this particulate organic carbon interacts with 350 nm ultraviolet light, dissolved inorganic carbon is formed, removing even more oxygen from the environment in the forms of carbon dioxide, bicarbonate ions, and carbonate.

As the breakdown of this phytoplankton takes place, the more phosphorus turns into phosphates, and nitrogens turn into nitrates.

Therefore, controlling risk factors is crucial in those with known atherosclerosis to prevent progression of disease, and screening is recommended by some vascular disease specialists for those at increased risk, such as those with diabetes, smoking or a strong family history of cardiovascular disease.\n", "Screening tests typically use the non-invasive evaluation called the ", ", which compares the blood pressure between the arm and the ankle. This can help detect narrowing in the major vessels of the chest, abdomen, pelvis, and legs. CT scans of the heart with evaluations of coronary artery calcium are also used in some instances to stratify risk of coronary artery disease.\n", "Historically, open vascular surgical approaches were required for all critically advanced atherosclerotic disease. An ", " is a large operation, where blood flow is temporarily stopped using clamps, the vessel is cut open, the plaque removed and then the vessel resealed. If an occlusion is too dense or complex, a bypass could also be performed, where two segments of vessel are bridged by an additional vein or synthetic graft.\nModern endovascular approaches to treating atherosclerosis can include combinations of angioplasty, stenting, and atherectomy (removal of plaque).\n", "There are several systems for staging PAD, but an often used scale is the revised Rutherford classification.", " Plaque and blood flow can be evaluated using ", ", ", ", MR angiography, and catheter-based angiography to establish anatomic segments of disease. The severity of ischemia can be evaluated by correlating symptoms and non-invasive physiologic vascular studies including toe pressures, TCPO2, and skin perfusion studies.\n", "Certain monitored exercises, such as walking regimens, have been shown to significantly improve walking distance especially when used consistently for at least six months. When medical management fails, vascular interventional radiologists can attempt to restore blood flow to extremities using angioplasty and stenting. Sometimes repeat interventions are required. The goal of therapy is to maintain perfusion, avoid amputation and preserve the limb structure and function.\n", " refers to pathologic dilation of an artery to greater than 1.5 times its normal size.  True vascular aneurysms are due to degenerative processes in the wall of the artery. Aneurysms can be solitary or multiple and are sometimes found in association with various clinical syndromes, including forms of vasculitis or connective tissue diseases. Aneurysms are typically classified by major shapes, either fusiform (tubular) or saccular (eccentric). ", " is another broad term for an enlarged vessel, but is not necessarily pathological. Rupture is a dreaded complication of aneurysms that can lead to extensive, difficult to control bleeding. Aneurysms can also clot, or ", ", and rapidly occlude the involved vessel, leading to acute distal ischemia.\n", "A variety of endovascular grafts are available, and each has advantages and disadvantages depending on the characteristics of the aneurysm and patient.", "\n", "Dissection refers to a tear in the inner layer of the arterial wall. Blood pumps into this defect and dissects its way between the layers in the wall of an artery, creating a false channel separate from the true arterial lumen. Dissections can develop due to trauma, spontaneously due to high blood pressure and native vascular disease, or in some cases as a complication of prior surgical or endovascular treatment.\n", "When an arterial dissection expands, it can restrict normal flow through the affected artery or potentially block the origin of a branch vessel—this can compromise distal perfusion in either case. When acute and symptomatic, this is an emergency that requires prompt treatment.\n", "However, as medical imaging has improved, chronic, asymptomatic dissections have also been discovered, and in some cases these may be safely managed with blood pressure control, follow-up imaging and proper counseling for the warning signs of potential ischemia.\n", "Dissections can occur in any artery and are named for their vessel of origin. ", " can be further classified and treated depending on whether they involve the thoracic aorta, the abdominal aorta or both. Classic pain related to acute aortic dissections is described as \"tearing\" or \"ripping\" and possibly radiating to a patient's back. Acute aortic dissection can be difficult to diagnose but is more common than aortic aneurysm rupture.\n", "Thoracic aortic dissections are further characterized with the Stanford classification.", " Type A dissections involve the root and ascending aorta. These require prompt treatment, which currently is mostly surgical in nature.  Type B dissections begin in the distal aortic arch beyond the left subclavian artery origin, and may often be addressed with pain medication and blood pressure control. If the type B aortic dissection results in poor circulation to the intestines, kidneys or legs it often requires urgent endovascular repair with endografts and/or fenestrations. If a type B aortic dissection has ruptured, or has features that indicate impending rupture, they are urgently repaired too.\n", "Dissections can also arise in virtually any other artery. Carotid artery dissection, for example, places patients at increased risk for stroke and may extend further into the blood vessels within the brain. ", " are less common but also dangerous for similar reasons. Mesenteric artery dissection may limit the blood supply to the intestines. Renal artery dissections can decrease blood flow to the kidneys and contribute to hypertension.", " Peripheral arterial dissections can be found elsewhere in the arms and legs. These dissections can occur primarily due to focal traumas, underlying vascular disease, or as an extension of a larger, complex aortic dissection that tears further into these smaller branches.\n", "Treatment of dissections depends on several factors, including the location, extent, how long it has been developing (acute or chronic) and whether it is limiting perfusion. Surgical approaches to dissections can include reconstructing the aorta, surgical bypass and surgical fenestration.  Like other arterial disorders, endovascular approaches to dissection such as stent-grafting", " and percutaneous fenestration", " can be utilized, either primarily or in combination with surgery depending on the complexity of the dissection.\n", "Penetrating aortic ulcer (PAU) is an advanced focal form of atherosclerosis, most often encountered in the aorta.", " It starts as a small plaque in the inner-most layer of the aorta called the intima, but the inflammatory process ulcerates and penetrates through this layer into the media. While PAU is considered a distinct entity, many think this is a precursor lesion to dissection or aneurysm.", " Along with intramural hematoma, aneurysm and dissection, PAU is recognized as one of several ", "—a spectrum of related conditions correlated to potential aortic rupture. They thus have a high potential morbidity and mortality, and should at least be followed closely.\n", "Acute or active bleeding can occur throughout the human body due to a variety of causes. Interventional radiologists can address bleeding with embolization, usually with small plastic particles, glues or coils. Traumatic rupture of a blood vessel, for example, may be addressed this way if a patient is at risk of fatal bleeding. This has revolutionized medicine and interventional radiologists commonly treat refractory nose bleeds, excessive coughing of blood, intestinal bleeding, post-pregnancy bleeding, spontaneous intra-abdominal on intra-thoracic bleeding, bleeding related to trauma and post-surgical bleeding. In some instances where severe bleeding is anticipated, such as in complex surgery or the excision of a highly vascular tumor, interventional radiologists may embolize certain target blood vessels prior to the operation to prevent major blood loss.\n", "Transplant organs rely on healthy blood supply to survive. In some instances, the arteries that feed a transplant may narrow, typically where the donor vessel is sewn to the recipient. Interventional radiologists evaluate the blood supply of these patient's and may use balloons or stents to open narrowed vessels and keep the transplant organ functional.\n", "The ", " of the human body are responsible for returning de-oxygenated blood back to the heart. Like a rock rolling down a hill, blood flows from the highest pressure (the blood in the aorta) to the lower venous pressure (the blood in the vena cava as it empties back to the heart.) Unlike arteries, veins are thin walled and distensible, allowing them to accommodate large volumes of blood without significant changes in pressure. In fact, the venous system is so low pressure that veins have valves to keep blood from flowing backward. The motion of the human body helps pump blood through the veins—squeezing leg muscles while walking, for instance, helps push venous blood back up to the heart against the pull of gravity. Unfortunately, without this extra push some blood can sit stagnant in veins, leading to a multitude of clinical problems. The largest vein in the body is the vena cava. The superior vena cava (SVC) drains blood from the top half of the body while the inferior vena cava (IVC) drains blood from below the diaphragm. Elsewhere in the body, veins can be categorized into superficial, primarily associated with the skin and soft tissues, or deep veins, which drain muscles and organs.\n", " (CKD or chronic renal disease) is a condition in which there is a progressive loss of kidney function. It has numerous recognized causes and risk factors. CKD affects approximately 14% of the world population, and over 600,000 people in the United States alone.  There are five recognized stages of CKD; the fifth stage is also called end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and invariably requires some form of ", ".\n", "Around the turn of the 20th century, breakthroughs in understanding of renal physiology led many to believe that dialysis using ", " was a potential cure for renal disease. Over 100 years later, the only available curative, renal replacement therapy for CKD is kidney transplantation. However, many patients can live for decades utilizing dialysis.\n", "Dialyzer technology initially outpaced the ability of clinicians to apply it to patients. In the 1920s, the first dialysis catheter was created using thin fragile glass tubes. Early methods required surgical incision to reach large vessels, which carried a large risk of major bleeding. The first somewhat permanent, reliable dialysis access, the ", ", was invented nearly 40 years later and allowed a patient with ", " to survive 11 more years. As medicine and surgery have grown more sophisticated, more patients now live with chronic renal disease than ever before. The most common type of dialysis in the United States is hemodialysis, which can be performed through several types of vascular access. The arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is the preferred method.  Arteriovenous fistula are created surgically by directly connecting an artery and a vein, most commonly in the arm. An arteriovenous graft (AVG) relies on the same principle but bridges the gap between the artery and vein with a medical-grade prosthetic shunt. Over time, altered flow mechanics can result in changes within the involved vessels.  Vascular narrowing, thrombosis, aneurysms and pseudoaneurysms are commonly encountered complications over the life of an AVF or AVG. Interventional radiologists can use angiography to evaluate these structures (commonly called a istulogram) and treat dysfunctional access with angioplasty, stenting, and thrombectomy. Most patients require regular evaluation and treatment to keep their access working.  When possible, AVFs are preferred to AVGs due to their relatively lower complication rate and longer patency. The Fistula First initiative works to promote physician and patient awareness about the benefits of first attempting hemodialysis through a fistula.", "  There are a few devices (endo AVF) that are being utilized by interventional radiologists to percutaneously create fistulas in a minimally invasive fashion.\n", "Dialysis catheters include temporary and tunneled large-bore central venous access lines placed for administering hemodialysis. When possible, these catheters are placed in the right internal jugular vein, but the left internal jugular and femoral veins may also be utilized. Temporary dialysis lines may be placed when patients are hospitalized and either too sick or at a high risk of bleeding. Permanent hemodialysis catheters are longer overall but a segment is tunneled through the skin of the chest, which lets the catheter lie flat and lowers the risk of infection.\n", "Central venous access refers to a variety of intravenous catheters placed in patients requiring certain long-term medications. These are much smaller in diameter than dialysis lines, but are larger and longer than a standard intravenous line (IV.) Examples include Hickman catheters, peripherally inserted central cathethers (or PICCs), tunneled small bore central venous catheters, and mediports. These lines differ in where they are inserted but are all placed under imaging guidance and adjusted so the end of the catheter sits in the vena cava adjacent to the heart. These catheters are designed to deliver strong medications, such as chemotherapy or prolonged courses of antibiotics, which are either dosed too frequently to keep placing new IVs or are too irritating to small veins be injected through a standard IV.\n"]},

Unlike traditional radiology, which records radiation transmitted through the body from external sources like X-ray generators, nuclear imaging records radiation emitted from within the body. The focus of nuclear medicine scans is on the function of organs and tissues rather than their anatomy. This is why it is referred to as a physiological imaging modality. Nuclear medicine utilises two primary imaging modalities, single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) scans. These are commonly used in the field. It is important to note that SPECT and PET scans are the two most common imaging modalities in nuclear medicine.\n", "In nuclear medicine imaging, ", " are taken internally, for example, through inhalation, intravenously, or orally.

Nuclear medicine imaging studies are generally more organ-, tissue- or disease-specific (e.g.: lungs scan, heart scan, bone scan, brain scan, tumor, infection, Parkinson etc.) than those in conventional radiology imaging, which focus on a particular section of the body (e.g.: chest X-ray, abdomen/pelvis CT scan, head CT scan, etc.).

The radionuclide introduced into the body is often chemically bound to a complex that acts characteristically within the body; this is commonly known as a ", ". In the presence of disease, a tracer will often be distributed around the body and/or processed differently. For example, the ligand methylene-diphosphonate (", ") can be preferentially taken up by bone. By chemically attaching ", " to MDP, radioactivity can be transported and attached to bone via the hydroxyapatite for imaging. Any increased physiological function, such as due to a fracture in the bone, will usually mean increased concentration of the tracer. This often results in the appearance of a \"hot spot\", which is a focal increase in radio accumulation or a general increase in radio accumulation throughout the physiological system. Some disease processes result in the exclusion of a tracer, resulting in the appearance of a \"cold spot\". Many tracer complexes have been developed to image or treat many different organs, glands, and physiological processes.\n", "In some centers, the nuclear medicine scans can be superimposed, using software or hybrid cameras, on images from modalities such as CT or MRI to highlight the part of the body in which the radiopharmaceutical is concentrated. This practice is often referred to as image fusion or co-registration, for example SPECT/CT and PET/CT. The fusion imaging technique in nuclear medicine provides information about the anatomy and function, which would otherwise be unavailable or would require a more invasive procedure or surgery.\n", "Although the risks of low-level radiation exposures are not well understood, a cautious approach has been universally adopted that all human radiation exposures should be kept As Low As Reasonably Practicable, \"ALARP\". (Originally, this was known as \"As Low As Reasonably Achievable\" (ALARA), but this has changed in modern draftings of the legislation to add more emphasis on the \"Reasonably\" and less on the \"Achievable\".)\n", "Working with the ALARP principle, before a patient is exposed for a nuclear medicine examination, the benefit of the examination must be identified.

For instance, if a patient is unlikely to be able to tolerate a sufficient amount of the procedure to achieve a diagnosis, then it would be inappropriate to proceed with injecting the patient with the radioactive tracer.\n", "When the benefit does justify the procedure, then the radiation exposure (the amount of radiation given to the patient) should also be kept as low as reasonably practicable. This means that the images produced in nuclear medicine should never be better than required for confident diagnosis. Giving larger radiation exposures can reduce the noise in an image and make it more photographically appealing, but if the clinical question can be answered without this level of detail, then this is inappropriate.\n", "As a result, the radiation dose from nuclear medicine imaging varies greatly depending on the type of study.

The X-rays are projected through the body onto a detector; an image is formed based on which rays pass through (and are detected) versus those that are absorbed or scattered in the patient (and thus are not detected). Röntgen discovered X-rays on November 8, 1895, and received the first ", " for his discovery in 1901.\n", "In film-screen radiography, an X-ray tube generates a beam of X-rays, which is aimed at the patient. The X-rays that pass through the patient are filtered through a device called a grid or ", ", to reduce scatter, and strike an undeveloped film, which is held tightly to a screen of light-emitting phosphors in a light-tight cassette.

Due to its availability, speed, and lower costs compared to other modalities, radiography is often the first-line test of choice in radiologic diagnosis. Also despite the large amount of data in CT scans, MR scans and other digital-based imaging, there are many disease entities in which the classic diagnosis is obtained by plain radiographs. Examples include various types of arthritis and pneumonia, bone tumors (especially benign bone tumors), fractures, congenital skeletal anomalies, and certain kidney stones.\n", " and ", " are two applications of low energy projectional radiography, used for the evaluation for ", " and ", ", respectively.\n", "Fluoroscopy and ", " are special applications of ", " imaging, in which a fluorescent screen and image intensifier tube is connected to a closed-circuit television system.", " This allows real-time imaging of structures in motion or augmented with a ", " agent. Radiocontrast agents are usually administered by swallowing or injecting into the body of the patient to delineate anatomy and functioning of the blood vessels, the ", ", or the ", " (GI tract). Two radiocontrast agents are presently in common use. Barium sulfate (BaSO", ") is given orally or rectally for evaluation of the GI tract.

These radiocontrast agents strongly absorb or scatter X-rays, and in conjunction with the real-time imaging, allow demonstration of dynamic processes, such as ", " in the digestive tract or blood flow in arteries and veins. Iodine contrast may also be concentrated in abnormal areas more or less than in normal tissues and make abnormalities (", ", ", ", ", ") more conspicuous. Additionally, in specific circumstances, air can be used as a contrast agent for the gastrointestinal system and carbon dioxide can be used as a contrast agent in the venous system; in these cases, the contrast agent attenuates the X-ray radiation less than the surrounding tissues.\n", "CT imaging uses X-rays in conjunction with computing ", " to image the body.", "\nIn CT, an X-ray tube opposite an X-ray detector (or detectors) in a ring-shaped apparatus rotate around a patient, producing a computer-generated cross-sectional image (tomogram).", " CT is acquired in the ", " plane, with coronal and sagittal images produced by computer reconstruction. Radiocontrast agents are often used with CT for enhanced delineation of anatomy. Although radiographs provide higher spatial resolution, CT can detect more subtle variations in attenuation of X-rays (higher contrast resolution). CT exposes the patient to significantly more ionizing radiation than a radiograph.\n", "Spiral multidetector CT uses 16, 64, 254 or more detectors during continuous motion of the patient through the radiation beam to obtain fine detail images in a short exam time. With rapid administration of intravenous contrast during the CT scan, these fine detail images can be reconstructed into three-dimensional (3D) images of carotid, cerebral, coronary or other arteries.\n", "The introduction of computed tomography in the early 1970s revolutionized diagnostic radiology by providing front-line clinicians with detailed images of anatomic structures in three dimensions. CT scanning has become the test of choice in diagnosing some urgent and emergent conditions, such as cerebral hemorrhage, ", " (clots in the arteries of the lungs), ", " (tearing of the aortic wall), ", ", ", ", and obstructing kidney stones. Before the development of CT imaging, risky and painful ", " was often the only way to obtain a definitive diagnosis of the cause of severe abdominal pain which could not be otherwise ascertained from external observation.", " Continuing improvements in CT technology, including faster scanning times and improved resolution, have dramatically increased the accuracy and usefulness of CT scanning, which may partially account for increased use in medical diagnosis.\n", "Medical ultrasonography uses ultrasound (high-frequency sound waves) to visualize soft tissue structures in the body in real time.

Examinations of larger, ", " patients may have a decrease in image quality as their ", " absorbs more of the sound waves. This results in fewer sound waves penetrating to organs and reflecting back to the transducer, resulting in loss of information and a poorer quality image. Ultrasound is also limited by its inability to image through air pockets (lungs, bowel loops) or bone. Its use in medical imaging has developed mostly within the last 30 years. The first ultrasound images were static and two-dimensional (2D), but with modern ultrasonography, 3D reconstructions can be observed in real time, effectively becoming \"4D\".\n", "Because ultrasound imaging techniques do not employ ionizing radiation to generate images (unlike radiography, and CT scans), they are generally considered safer and are therefore more common in ", ".

With advances in scanning speed and spatial resolution, and improvements in computer 3D algorithms and hardware, MRI has become an important tool in musculoskeletal radiology and neuroradiology.\n", "One disadvantage is the patient has to hold still for long periods of time in a noisy, cramped space while the imaging is performed. Claustrophobia (fear of closed spaces) severe enough to terminate the MRI exam is reported in up to 5% of patients. Recent improvements in magnet design including stronger magnetic fields (3 ", "), shortening exam times, wider, shorter magnet bores and more open magnet designs, have brought some relief for claustrophobic patients. However, for magnets with equivalent field strengths, there is often a trade-off between image quality and open design. MRI has great benefit in imaging the brain, spine, and musculoskeletal system. The use of MRI is currently contraindicated for patients with pacemakers, cochlear implants, some indwelling medication pumps, certain types of cerebral aneurysm clips, metal fragments in the eyes and some metallic hardware due to the powerful magnetic fields and strong fluctuating radio signals to which the body is exposed. Areas of potential advancement include functional imaging, cardiovascular MRI, and MRI-guided therapy.\n", "Nuclear medicine imaging involves the administration into the patient of radiopharmaceuticals consisting of substances with affinity for certain body tissues labeled with radioactive tracer.

The positrons annihilate to produce two opposite traveling gamma rays to be detected coincidentally, thus improving resolution. In PET scanning, a radioactive, biologically active substance, most often ", "F-FDG, is injected into a patient and the radiation emitted by the patient is detected to produce multiplanar images of the body. Metabolically more active tissues, such as cancer, concentrate the active substance more than normal tissues. PET images can be combined (or \"fused\") with anatomic (CT) imaging, to more accurately localize PET findings and thereby improve diagnostic accuracy.\n", "The fusion technology has gone further to combine PET and MRI similar to PET and CT. ", " fusion, largely practiced in academic and research settings, could potentially play a crucial role in fine detail of brain imaging, breast cancer screening, and small joint imaging of the foot. The technology recently blossomed after passing the technical hurdle of altered positron movement in strong magnetic field thus affecting the resolution of PET images and attenuation correction.\n", "Interventional radiology (IR or sometimes VIR for vascular and interventional radiology) is a subspecialty of radiology in which minimally invasive procedures are performed using image guidance. Some of these procedures are done for purely diagnostic purposes (e.g., ", "), while others are done for treatment purposes (e.g., ", ").\n", "The basic concept behind interventional radiology is to diagnose or treat ", ", with the most minimally invasive technique possible.

It is most often used to allow rapid interpretation of emergency room, ICU and other emergent examinations after hours of usual operation, at night and on weekends. In these cases, the images can be sent across time zones (e.g. to Spain, Australia, India) with the receiving Clinician working his normal daylight hours. However, at present, large private teleradiology companies in the U.S. currently provide most after-hours coverage employing night-working radiologists in the U.S. Teleradiology can also be used to obtain consultation with an expert or subspecialist about a complicated or puzzling case. In the U.S., many hospitals outsource their radiology departments to radiologists in India due to the lowered cost and availability of high speed internet access.\n", "Teleradiology requires a sending station, a high-speed internet connection, and a high-quality receiving station.

The computer at the receiving end will need to have a high-quality display screen that has been tested and cleared for clinical purposes. Reports are then transmitted to the requesting clinician.\n", "The major advantage of teleradiology is the ability to use different time zones to provide real-time emergency radiology services around-the-clock. The disadvantages include higher costs, limited contact between the referrer and the reporting Clinician, and the inability to cover for procedures requiring an onsite reporting Clinician. Laws and regulations concerning the use of teleradiology vary among the states, with some requiring a license to practice medicine in the state sending the radiologic exam.

Other radiologists, like interventional radiologists, primarily interact with patients and spend less time analyzing images.  Diagnostic radiologists tend to spend the majority of their time analyzing images and a minority of their time interacting with patients. Compared to the healthcare provider who sends the patient to have images interpreted by a diagnostic radiologist, the radiologist usually does not know as much about the patient's clinical status or have as much influence on what action should be taken based on the images. Thus, the diagnostic radiologist reports image findings directly to that healthcare provider and often provides recommendations, who then takes the appropriate next steps for recommendations about medical management.

This friendly competition continued for decades. In modern times, the mutual interest of obstetricians, gynecologists, and urologists in pelvic floor problems in women has led to a more collaborative effort.\n", "Urogynecologists are medical professionals who have been to medical school and achieved their basic medical degree, followed by postgraduate training in Obstetrics and Gynaecology (OB-GYN).  They then undertake further training in Urogynecology to achieve accreditation/board certification in this subspecialty. Training programme requirements and duration varies from country to country but usually tend to be around 2–3 years in most places.

IUGA facilitates training for physicians from countries which do not have formal training programmes by maintaining and publishing a directory of fellowship programmes. IUGA also  provides educational opportunities for urogynecologists both online and in-person, develops terminology and standardization for the field. The International Continence Society (ICS) is another global organization which strives to improve the quality of life for people affected by urinary, bowel and pelvic floor disorders through education, and research.\n", "Urogynecology is a sub-specialty of Gynecology, and in some countries is also known as Female Pelvic Medicine and Reconstructive Surgery.  A urogynecologist manages clinical problems associated with dysfunction of the pelvic floor and bladder.  Pelvic floor disorders affect the bladder, reproductive organs, and bowels.  Common pelvic floor disorders include urinary incontinence, pelvic organ prolapse and fecal incontinence.  Increasingly, Urogynecologists are also responsible for the care of women who have experienced trauma to the perineum during childbirth.\n", "There is some crossover with the subspecialty of Female Urology - these doctors are urologists who undergo additional training to be able to manage female urinary incontinence, pelvic organ prolapse and interstitial cystitis/PBS.  In addition, there are colorectal surgeons who have a special interest in anal incontinence and pelvic floor dysfunction related to rectal function.  Contemporary urogynecological practice encourages multidisciplinary teams working in the care of patients, with collaborative input from urogynecologists, urologists, colorectal surgeons, ", " physicians, and physiotherapists.  This is especially important in the care of patients with complex problems, e.g. those who have undergone previous surgery or who have combined incontinence and prolapse, or combined urinary and bowel problems.  Multidisciplinary team meetings are an important part of the management pathway of these women.\n", "Urogynaecologists manage women with urinary incontinence and pelvic floor dysfunction.  The clinical conditions that a urogynecologist may see include stress incontinence, overactive bladder, voiding difficulty, bladder pain, urethral pain, vaginal or uterine prolapse, obstructed defecation, anal incontinence, and perineal injury.  They may also care for women with ", " or rectovaginal fistulae with specialist training, and in conjunction with other specialties.\n", "Patients will usually be assessed using a combination of history taking, examination (including pelvic examination and assessment of prolapse using validated systems such as the ", " and assessment of quality of life impact using validated questionnaires, including the assessment of sexual function, using Pelvic Organ Prolapse/Incontinence Sexual Questionnaire IUGA- Revised [PISQ-IR].  A bladder diary is often used to quantify an individual's fluid intake, and the number of voids per day and night, as well as the volume the bladder can hold on a day-to-day basis.  Further investigations might include urodynamics or a cystoscopy.  Treatment usually starts with conservative measures such as pelvic floor muscle training, fluid and food modification or bladder training.  Drug therapies can be used for overactive bladder, which may include antimuscarinic drugs or beta 3 receptor agonists - both of these help to control the urgency that is the key component of overactive bladder. If medications fail, more invasive options such as injections of botulinum toxin into the bladder muscle, or neuromodulation are other options for symptom relief.  Surgical treatments can be offered for stress incontinence and/or uterovaginal prolapse if pelvic floor muscle training is unsuccessful.\n", "Urogynecological problems are seldom life-threatening, but they do have a major impact on the quality of life of affected individuals.  Urogynecologists will usually use quality of life improvement as a treatment goal, and there is a major focus on optimising symptoms using conservative measures before embarking on more invasive treatments.\n", "Some conditions treated in urogynecology practice include:", "\n", "Diagnostic tests and procedures performed include:", "\n", "Specialty treatments available include:", "\n"]},

Advances are continually improving the technical performance of chromatography, allowing the separation of increasingly similar molecules.\n", "Chromatography is based on the concept of partition coefficient. Any solute partitions between two immiscible solvents. When we make one solvent immobile (by adsorption on a solid support matrix) and another mobile it results in most common applications of chromatography. If the matrix support, or stationary phase, is polar (e.g. paper, silica etc.) it is forward phase chromatography, and if it is non-polar (C-18) it is reverse phase.\n", "\n", "Column chromatography is a separation technique in which the stationary bed is within a tube. The particles of the solid stationary phase or the support coated with a liquid stationary phase may fill the whole inside volume of the tube (packed column) or be concentrated on or along the inside tube wall leaving an open, unrestricted path for the mobile phase in the middle part of the tube (open tubular column). Differences in rates of movement through the medium are calculated to different retention times of the sample.", "\nIn 1978, W. Clark Still introduced a modified version of column chromatography called ", " (flash).", " The technique is very similar to the traditional column chromatography, except that the solvent is driven through the column by applying positive pressure. This allowed most separations to be performed in less than 20 minutes, with improved separations compared to the old method. Modern flash chromatography systems are sold as pre-packed plastic cartridges, and the solvent is pumped through the cartridge. Systems may also be linked with detectors and fraction collectors providing automation. The introduction of gradient pumps resulted in quicker separations and less solvent usage.\n", "In ", ", a fluidized bed is used, rather than a solid phase made by a packed bed. This allows omission of initial clearing steps such as centrifugation and filtration, for culture broths or slurries of broken cells.\n", " chromatography utilizes the binding affinity of many DNA-binding proteins for phosphocellulose.

In elution mode, substances typically emerge from a column in narrow, Gaussian peaks. Wide separation of peaks, preferably to baseline, is desired for maximum purification. The speed at which any component of a mixture travels down the column in elution mode depends on many factors. But for two substances to travel at different speeds, and thereby be resolved, there must be substantial differences in some interaction between the biomolecules and the chromatography matrix. Operating parameters are adjusted to maximize the effect of this difference. In many cases, baseline separation of the peaks can be achieved only with gradient elution and low column loadings. Thus, two drawbacks to elution mode chromatography, especially at the preparative scale, are operational complexity, due to gradient solvent pumping, and low throughput, due to low column loadings. Displacement chromatography has advantages over elution chromatography in that components are resolved into consecutive zones of pure substances rather than \"peaks\". Because the process takes advantage of the nonlinearity of the isotherms, a larger column feed can be separated on a given column with the purified components recovered at significantly higher concentrations.\n", "Gas chromatography (GC), also sometimes known as gas-liquid chromatography, (GLC), is a separation technique in which the mobile phase is a gas. Gas chromatographic separation is always carried out in a column, which is typically \"packed\" or \"capillary\".  Packed columns are the routine work horses of gas chromatography, being cheaper and easier to use and often giving adequate performance.   Capillary columns generally give far superior resolution and although more expensive are becoming widely used, especially for complex mixtures. Further, capillary columns can be split into three classes: porous layer open tubular (PLOT), wall-coated open tubular (WCOT) and support-coated open tubular (SCOT) columns. PLOT columns are unique in a way that the stationary phase is adsorbed to the column walls, while WCOT columns have a stationary phase that is chemically bonded to the walls. SCOT columns are in a way the combination of the two types mentioned in a way that they have support particles adhered to column walls, but those particles have liquid phase chemically bonded onto them.", " Both types of column are made from non-adsorbent and chemically inert materials.

HPLC is historically divided into two different sub-classes based on the polarity of the mobile and stationary phases.

The average residence time in the pores depends upon the effective size of the analyte molecules. However, molecules that are larger than the average pore size of the packing are excluded and thus suffer essentially no retention; such species are the first to be eluted. It is generally a low-resolution chromatography technique and thus it is often reserved for the final, \"polishing\" step of a purification.

The expanded bed chromatographic separation column has advantages of increasing the separation efficiency of the expanded bed.\n", "Expanded-bed adsorption (EBA) chromatography is a convenient and effective technique for the capture of proteins directly from unclarified crude sample. In EBA chromatography, the settled bed is first expanded by upward flow of equilibration buffer. The crude feed, a mixture of soluble proteins, contaminants, cells, and cell debris, is then passed upward through the expanded bed. Target proteins are captured on the adsorbent, while particulates and contaminants pass through. A change to elution buffer while maintaining upward flow results in desorption of the target protein in expanded-bed mode. Alternatively, if the flow is reversed, the adsorbed particles will quickly settle and the proteins can be desorbed by an elution buffer. The mode used for elution (expanded-bed versus settled-bed) depends on the characteristics of the feed. After elution, the adsorbent is cleaned with a predefined cleaning-in-place (CIP) solution, with cleaning followed by either column regeneration (for further use) or storage.\n", "Reversed-phase chromatography (RPC) is any liquid chromatography procedure in which the mobile phase is significantly more polar than the stationary phase. It is so named because in normal-phase liquid chromatography, the mobile phase is significantly less polar than the stationary phase.

Separating columns typically comprise a C8 or C18 carbon-chain bonded to a silica particle substrate.\n", "Hydrophobic Interaction Chromatography (HIC) is a purification and analytical technique that separates analytes, such as proteins, based on hydrophobic interactions between that analyte and the chromatographic matrix. It can provide a non-denaturing orthogonal approach to reversed phase separation, preserving native structures and potentially protein activity.  In hydrophobic interaction chromatography, the matrix material is lightly substituted with hydrophobic groups. These groups can range from methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, octyl, or phenyl groups.", " At high salt concentrations, non-polar sidechains on the surface on proteins \"interact\" with the hydrophobic groups; that is, both types of groups are excluded by the polar solvent (hydrophobic effects are augmented by increased ionic strength). Thus, the sample is applied to the column in a buffer which is highly polar, which drives an association of hydrophobic patches on the analyte with the stationary phase. The eluent is typically an aqueous buffer with decreasing salt concentrations, increasing concentrations of detergent (which disrupts hydrophobic interactions), or changes in pH.  Of critical importance is the type of salt used, with more ", " salts as defined by the ", " providing the most water structuring around the molecule and resulting hydrophobic pressure.  Ammonium sulfate is frequently used for this purpose.

Three different heating techniques are used in actual pyrolyzers: Isothermal furnace, inductive heating (Curie Point filament), and resistive heating using platinum filaments. Large molecules cleave at their weakest points and produce smaller, more volatile fragments. These fragments can be separated by gas chromatography. Pyrolysis GC chromatograms are typically complex because a wide range of different decomposition products is formed.

The Secretariat sought to mislead the international community through the Secretary-General's Reports and briefings it prepared, so as to pressure a small state effectively to accept the consequences of aggression by a large neighbouring state allied to two ", ".\"\n", "\"The terms of the Annan Plan would in fact have embedded instability into the heart of a Cyprus settlement and would inevitably have led to increasing friction and destabilisation. This is underlined by the provisions concerning the position of foreign nationals with effective control over key areas of governmental activities in Cyprus. Examples where non-Cypriots would (in the event of disagreement between the equal numbers of Greek and Turkish Cypriots) have effective control appeared to include the Reconciliation Commission; the Supreme Court invested with legislative and executive powers; the Central Bank; the Relocation Board; the Property Court and the organs of the Property Board. Bearing in mind the experience of the period 1960–63, the need for stability in the ordering of governmental activities is critical. Further, the foreign nationals concerned would not be democratically accountable to the people of Cyprus.\"\n", "\"With regard to the referendums in Cyprus, Parliament's primary objective should be to apply to itself the principles which it is shouting from the rooftops: observance of human rights and respect for democracy. On the first point, the Annan plan raises fundamental objections. How could the European Parliament endorse a proposed settlement which denies refugees the right to recover the property taken from them, which constitutes a permanent restriction on people's freedom of movement and establishment, which perpetuates the presence of occupying troops and which does not provide any recourse against violations of human rights before the Strasbourg Court? On the second point, Parliament must not go along with the scandalous pressure being piled onto the Greek Cypriots by both the United States and the European Commission – and in particular by Commissioner Verheugen, one of the keenest advocates of Turkey's accession to the European Union. The rule of democracy means that the decision of the people must be respected, especially if expressed in the most undeniable way in this respect: a referendum.\"\n", "\"The parties to the UN negotiations, Greece, Turkey, the (Greek) Cypriot government and the (still internationally unrecognized) Turkish Cypriot administration met in April at Bürgenstock in Switzerland, having allowed Kofi Annan in advance to make his own arbitration decisions on any unresolved issues when the negotiations ended; in their final stages a last minute tranche of extra demands were made by the Turkish military—which the Turkish Cypriots had not asked for and did not want. Urged on by the EU and the US, Annan accepted them all—including the proposal that Turkish troops remain in the island in perpetuity. This concession was calculated to smooth the path of Turkey towards EU membership (the deadline for negotiation on which has been set for the end of 2004) and to demonise the Greek Cypriots as scapegoats if a political solution did not materialise. In the short term this part of the plot has worked. The Turkish Cypriot \"yes\" and the Greek Cypriot \"no\" in the subsequent referenda generated carefully choreographed accusations against the Greek Cypriots of \"democratic irresponsibility\", not wanting the island's reunification and jeopardising Turkey's EU membership.\"\n", "\"The final version of the plan isn't a package on which the parties ever agreed. It is a mass of coercions written by aides to the UN secretary-general saying, 'this meets you halfway' and then communicated to the parties. Secondly, there's no precedent in international law of bringing such a blueprint to a referendum. A referendum should be based on a definite text prepared by an authority, or it should be a text on which the parties are agreed so that the people know that the agreement will be accepted if they vote in its favor. None of these conditions now exists. The UN General Secretariat, whose authority is controversial, exercised its 'goodwill mission' [good offices mission] granted by the Security Council and made the parties accept it through threats and deception. The text is devoid of compromise. Thirdly, setting aside judicial disagreements on various issues, this 'map of zones' is a map being presented to those who'll live there without any discussion.\"\n", "\n"]},

The route of the Expressway necessitated the paving over of parkland, demolition of residences and a popular amusement park, and a long elevated section to get through the downtown area. Planning was done stage-by-stage, from the Humber River east through downtown. The Humber Bay section was built according to initial plans. The route in the Exhibition Place area changed over time from one along the lake shore into downtown, to one aligned along the railway north of Exhibition Place. The initial route east of Exhibition Place would have necessitated the moving or removal of Old Fort York, but was moved to a more southerly alignment after protest.

Margison's plan was delivered in April 1954. The roadway was to be constructed in the Sunnyside area and CNE grounds to the south of the present Lake Shore Boulevard. South of the CNE grounds, the route would be on lands created from infilling of the shoreline to the breakwaters and an interchange was proposed in front of the Prince's Gate.

The expressway was moved to the north of Lake Shore Boulevard in the Sunnyside segment and the Jameson Avenue area.\n", "The inland route, while not opposed in the Sunnyside and Jameson areas, faced opposition in its proposed route in the CNE to downtown segment. Alternative route proposals emerged in 1954 from the Toronto Harbour Commission, which wanted the route moved further north, and planner Edwin Kay, who proposed a tunnel through downtown.", " The decision was then made to proceed with the non-contentious parts of the original Margison plan, to build a new Humber bridge to connect with the QEW, the Queen Street extension, and the Humber River to Dowling section, demolishing Sunnyside Park and South Parkdale. Metro also approved the eastern section of the expressway from ", " to the east, but the central, elevated section was left for further deliberation.

To make up for the loss of lands, Metro infilled into Lake Ontario to the breakwater.\n", "East of the CNE grounds, the inland route proposed to fly over ", " with a westbound on-ramp from Bathurst Street directly over the fort. Opposition from historical societies and the City of Toronto came to a head when the city refused to transfer the land to Metro Toronto. Gardiner himself and George O.

A pedestrian bridge crossing was built from the foot of Roncesvalles Avenue to the Palais Royale site.\n", "To the east of Sunnyside, the 1800s-era 'South Parkdale' residential neighbourhood at the foot of Jameson Avenue was demolished in 1957. The Expressway, like the railway just to the north, was cut through the area at lake shore level. An interchange was built at Jameson with on and off ramps to Lake Shore Boulevard, and Lake Shore Boulevard was expanded to six lanes in the area. This created a pedestrian barrier to the lake shore for Parkdale neighbourhood residents to the north. Efforts made by community groups over the next 20 years to restore access to the lake shore, including plans to cover the section of the Expressway and railway line, did not come to fruition. A pedestrian bridge over Lake Shore Boulevard at the foot of Jameson Avenue was eventually built. Jameson Avenue, which had previously been a street of mansions, saw intense apartment building development after the building of the Expressway.\n", "The section between Humber River and Jameson Avenue was completed in 1958.

The Gardiner passes over some of the fort's property, and it is extra high to allow for possible multiple interchanges.", "\n", "East of Fort York, the Gardiner was built entirely as an elevated route, through a predominantly industrial area, to the south of railway lands to reach downtown. The roadway was built directly overhead of Fleet Street (Fleet is now Lake Shore Boulevard West east of Bathurst but Fleet exists as parallel roadway on the north side from Bathurst to Strachan Avenue) through much of this section. The expressway off-ramp to York/Bay/Yonge Streets was developed as a two-lane eastbound 'finger' flying over Harbour Street, south of the main roadway, descending to Harbour Street with a circular off-ramp to York Street northbound, and it was nicknamed the \"Hot Wheels Ramp\".\n", "This segment was completed in 1964. In the original proposal, the elevated segment would descend to ground level and meet the Don Valley Parkway at a clover-leaf interchange.

In 1732 the Spanish crown created a Military Directorate and established a number of battalions, and had a few units from infantry regiments based in Spain arrive in the area. Reform of the military in the colonies began a few decades later. The first squadrons of cavalry arrived from Spain in 1751. The first batteries of Artillery were officially raised just two years later. Both ", " and ", " were allowed to enter the ranks of the artillery companies. That same year, a Fixed Caracas Battalion was established. Until the creation of this battalion, defense had been based on small colonial ", ", which initially only accepted whites. Gradually, this racist policy yielded and the entry of mixed-race people was allowed in the militias. It was from these various units that the bulk of the officers who fought in the battles of the ", " emerged. Among them were Generalissimo ", ", ", " (Bolívar's own father had been Colonel of the Militia of Aragua), General in chief ", ", ", ", among many other heroes. With the establishment of an independent ", " in the latter half of the 18th century, the Spanish troops quartered in the province passed to the direct command of Caracas. The troops in the other provinces of the country, under the command of local governors, were overseen by the Captain General of Caracas, who served as commander in chief of the armed services. In this way a series of autonomous units was created for the peoples of the area and for defense duties, open to all fit males regardless of color. Aside from these the Spanish Navy also operated naval bases in the Captaincy General's territorial coastline, open to both whites and blacks as well.\n", "Already in the early 19th century, many of these Venezuelans who had formed the bulk of the officer corps at the start of the formation of the national armed forces began to arrive in the country after participating in military campaigns abroad in the ", ", the French Revolution, or after completing their studies in Europe. With them came a number of mercenaries and volunteers of many different nationalities: English, Scottish, Irish, French, German, Brazilian, Poles, Russians, and others. It was only in 1810 in the aftermath of the coup d'état of 19 April that year that formally began the process of raising the national armed services. Several of the military officers of the colonial military forces supported the coup and the subsequent creation of a junta. That Supreme Junta later appointed Commander Lino de Clemente to be in charge of defense affairs for the Captaincy General, and thus the armed forces began to be formed through their efforts, including the opening of a full military academy in Caracas for the training of officers, later joined by a naval academy in La Guaira for naval officer education the following year.\n", "It could be said that in the first two decades of the 19th century, the nascent Liberation Army and Navy, was in the midst of the intellectual training of their military cadres, in various attempts to unleash the revolutionary war, and trying to build a modern army and navy. In the midst of that task came the generalissimo Francisco de Miranda, and the Liberator Simón Bolívar, who called for immediate action to, once and for all, ensure the independence of the nation, achieved through the aforementioned 19 April coup of 1810 and later through the formal enactment of the 1811 Venezuelan Declaration of Independence. Bolívar surprised his military colleagues, when he rejected part of the Napoleonic military assumptions, habits and behaviors, took more British soldiers and those from other nations, and even through third parties requested the assistance of the British Crown for the formation of the regular army and navy for the growing republic. And he did made no mistake indeed: the 19th century, ultimately, was dominated by British and Prussian military influences. Once in battle, Bolívar began to develop his own tactics, military strategies and practices, whose legacy remains till this day in the National Armed Forces, and led to victory after victory and the full liberation of not just Venezuela, but of northern South America, through battles in both land and sea until the wars ended in 1824.\n", "During the second half of the 19th century, a school for officers continued (Military Academy of Mathematics, which was decades in advance of the policy of unification of arms and services of the Spanish military academy, which was in fact after to the Venezuelan one), a standing Army, weapons, and creating new services including the Corps of Sappers. This phase of the Venezuelan Army, is marked by infighting and a domain of local militias with no training (the ", " was one example). The little outside help in military matters at this stage is limited to the British and the later Chilean military missions, which began the long modernization of the army and navy.

This modernization was done with the help of instructors and advisers from Chile, France, Italy and Germany. The late Prussian influence did not reach the Venezuelan Army from the Germans, but from the Chilean military instructors in 1910. One of the most important reforms undertaken during the Gómez regime of the National Armed Forces, which began in 1910 with the aim of making the national armed services uniform, modern and technically advanced in this era of the 20th century.\n", "The reform coincided with the centennial anniversary of the Venezuelan Declaration of Independence, which contributed to the doctrinal and political cohesion of the army and the navy. The most important milestones of this reform were:\n", "In 1910, operation of the Military Academy of Venezuela that was reformed in 1903 started,  and within it, the Naval Academy (then called Naval School of Venezuela), establishing the School of Application for Military officers in active service with the aim of upgrading their military expertise. In 1913 the Superior Technical Office responsible for the development of military doctrine, organization and training of the army, was founded.\n", "In 1920 the Military Aviation School of Venezuela was established. It was located in Maracay and was inaugurated the first of January of the next year to train the nation's military pilots.\n", "In 1923/1930 a new Code of Military law was adopted  that superseded all previous military laws and responded to the new political and military situation in the country. This process was accompanied by the modernization of the infrastructure, provision of arms, equipment, uniforms and a sustained growth of the military budget, which was made possible by oil revenues. The reform had a strong German influence.

So jealous of the Venezuelan Army, over the subsequent decades, the armed forces kept a precarious existing French influence, as a balance to the overwhelming American influence in the armed forces. Between the years 1945 and 1952, there was a major program of military equipment purchases almost monopolized by the United States (although other military material was acquired from other countries, mostly NATO countries) plus the military missions sent by that country, and later repeated again in the early years of the decade of the 1970s, albeit in a more balanced way by their countries of origin.\n", "At this time, the armed forces were composed of the traditional air force, army, navy and national guard.", "\n", "The armed services made their mark in the 1960s in stopping anti-government actions and even two rebellions from within its very own ranks.

The City is divided into several platforms. It is home to 20 billion members from three species: the winged Nah; the plant-based keh-Topli, who occasionally engage in reverent and consensual consumption of sentient species; and the @At, digital beings who can take physical form using light projectors. The three species initially lived on two separate planets until the Burnover, when they destroyed their homeworlds during a war sparked by the Cloud ", " (an empire of powerful alien conquerors that the three species drove to extinction). To prevent further conflict, the three species bioengineered a virus called the Emotion Exploit to tone down their emotions. Although it limited their ability to create entertainment, the Exploit prevented them from making rash and destructive decisions. They then came together to create the City from the remains of their planets.  Since then, the three species have lived peacefully under the rule of the Trilogy Council for centuries. The Trilogy Council consists of one member of each species; they are elected by their respective species, their position is lifelong, and their power is unrestricted. \n", "In Platform Ever Forward, a district of the City, the first murder in 500 years has occurred. An autopsy and an analysis of the suspect’s stomach contents show that the victim, Stevn of the Glacier, was eaten. Sojourner “Jo” Mullein and Peace Accountant Syzn discuss the murder with the Council, consisting of the Nah Marth, the @At @Blaze-of-Glory, and the keh-Topli Averrup. They believe that the keh-Topli suspect, Meile Thorn, was under the influence of Switchoff, a drug that nullifies the Emotion Exploit. After the council meeting concludes, Jo goes to see Meile. Upon entering Meile’s jail cell, Jo discovers that Meile has just been killed, and the Nah perpetrator flees the cell. Sojourner pursues the Nah, but fails to capture her.\n", "Jo goes to Marth’s home to ask him for contact information so she can speak to Stevn's family. During their meeting, Marth makes multiple romantic gestures and reveals that he and Council members in the past have taken Switchoff.\n", "The next day, Syzn messages Jo asking her to quell an unapproved protest of over a hundred thousand people in Platform Forget Not. The protest consists of Switchoff users, who want the Exploit abolished, and counter-protestors who want Switchoff banned and the Emotion Exploit to be kept active. Jo calms down the protestors by promising to give the Council the Switchoff users’ viewpoints, but Marth orders firing on the protestors in order to “keep the peace”. Jo uses her powers to shield the unarmed protestors, minimizing fatalities, and chastises the Peace Division officers for their attack.\n", "After the protest, An, Stevn's wife, signals Jo. She reveals that she organized the protest, believing her husband wouldn't have died if the keh-Topli who ate him had the opportunity to learn to regulate her emotions so Meile could have learned to control her desire safely. They demand that Jo presents their demand to the Council or the protests will continue even with the threat of being killed by the Peace Department.\n", "The next day, Jo brings the protestors’ concerns to the Council. The Council, believing that the Switchoff epidemic is out of control and knowing that murder and civil unrest have occurred the previous twelve times citizens called for an end of the Exploit, has turned their focus from preventing additional murders to preventing dissolution of the City at any cost. Jo swears that as long as she’s around, she will protect the City from the violence of the Council.\n", "A week later, the Council formally apologies for their deadly use of force and sets a date for a referendum on the Exploit. Jo searches through information about purchasing Switchoff, but the drug is purchased from throwaway companies using untraceable cryptocurrencies. Canhaz, Jo’s assistant, mentions that she and many other @At have spent years mining cryptocurrency when times were rough. This leads Jo to remember her life on Earth where she joined the army and then the police force in an attempt to make the world a fairer place. A Guardian praised Jo for her commitment to justice and reporting her partner for police brutality before her firing, and offered her a position as a Green Lantern.\n", "Jo meets with An again, who knows that the Council will likely ignore the demands of the people but the protestors will fight for change anyway. The discussion reignites Jo’s concerns that she is being used by the Council to uphold the status quo instead of protecting the City’s people. Jo gets a call from Averrup, who believes that Meile was not acting out of her own volition when she ate Stevn, as she was a strict vegetarian and much of Stevn’s body remained.\n", "Three days later,  Marth comes to Jo’s apartment to apologize for his order and to reveal that he will resign from his position after the referendum. He also tells her that he takes Switchoff to reflect on the decisions he makes as a Councilor under the Exploit. The two talk further discuss Marth’s experiences with Switchoff, then make out and have intercourse.\n", "The morning after, Averrup calls Jo and asks her to immediately come to his location. Jo calls Syzn for backup, then she and Canhaz fly to a wholesale warehouse in Platform Ever Forward. Jo enters the building and is attacked by armor machines from the long defunct Cloud Kratocracy. The machines are piloted by Nah and keh-Topli pilots, including an unresponsive Averrup. Canhaz suspects that the pilot’s bodies have been killed and taken over by @At, who can control biological beings by taking over their nervous systems. An outraged Jo destroys the machines. Canhaz detects that the @At have escaped the pilot’s bodies into the City Network, the City’s equivalent to the internet. Jo uses her ring to enter the City Network with Canhaz to track down the @At pilots in Atville. After exploring Atville, the two confront and capture the three suspects. When interrogated, the suspects reveal that they had little knowledge of the details behind their job. They state that they were tasked with taking over Meile’s body under the request of their anonymous employer and were instructed to kill anyone using her body. \n", "Havesh Stump replaces Averrup as the Councilor. He questions if it is proper for the emotional Jo to carry on the investigation, while Blaze-of-Glory believes that the @At suspects were being exploited by the returning Clout Kratocracy. Jo storms out of the Council meeting, accusing the Council of not taking responsibility and for not letting her do her job.  Marth apologizes for the Council’s behavior and tells Jo to look up the Feelsnet.\n", "The next day, Jo and Canhaz are at a diner. Canhaz states that due to their dependence on digital media for nutrition and currency, the @At originally voted against the Exploit. She also notes that the majority of the other two races didn’t want it either, but the Nah Councilor of the time secretly applied it to the whole city. Canhaz then tells her that the Feelsnet is used for the exchange of illegal or scarce content, particularly memes made by residents of the City. Jo realizes that Switchoff users are being used as a black market commodity since they become emotional enough to produce creative content.\n", "Jo goes to Platform Solid Ground to investigate a tip from Marth. Syzn doubts Marth’s trustworthiness, and warns Jo about the risk she’s taking, as Jo’s ring is still low on power after the trip to Atville and Jo has refused backup. Jo flies to what appears to be a secret military facility. She knocks out a guard, takes their clothing, and sneaks into the building. She finds out that the building is a sweatshop-like facility filled with residents who are forced to take Switchoff to produce ", " and are collared to prevent escape.\n", "Jo is captured by security guards after she reveals herself as the Green Lantern to fight guards forcibly giving Switchoff to a resident. Syzn meets Jo in the CEPD headquarters, asking Jo to plead “temporary emotional insanity” as an explanation for her actions, and tells her that dealing with the Switchoff facilities is too complicated to take care of before tomorrow’s Exploit referendum. Jo realizes that Meile was one of the residents, and was used by Switchoff dealers after she escaped to set an example. She commands Syzn to not let the sweatshops or the murders be swept under the rug because of the Council’s apathy.\n", "Syzn allows Marth to visit Jo the next morning. With help from Canhaz and the CEPD, Jo has figured out that Marth owns the sweatshop (as well as multiple others) and is the main funder of Switchoff production. Marth explains that his ancestor was the one who imposed the Exploit, and while it served its purpose in the past, he wants to end it without disrupting the status quo so much that fortunes and power are disrupted. He is using the facilities to fund a revolution, and gave Jo the “tip” so she could investigate if the facility she entered wasn’t using voluntary residents like the others. He and Averrup asked for a Green Lantern so they could use her to encourage support for the referendum. Syzn comes in to arrest Marth for trafficking and conspiracy to murder under Glory’s request. Canhaz calls Jo to tell her that the Council has shut down half of the referendum voting servers, limiting the ability to vote, especially for the @At. Jo, Canhaz, and Marth enter the Council chambers to confront Glory, who has ordered the military to fire on rioters angry at their ability to vote being impeded (although they refuse to do so). Glory explains that she was waiting for the referendum since the CEPD’s forces would be spread thin so she could take control of a military and use force against the biological civilians.\n", "The chamber is suddenly rocked by an explosion. Lumir, the Council’s seneshall and an anti-Exploit supporter, states that it is an antibomb (small weapons of mass destruction that release antimatter pulses) and more will go off all over the City if the referendum servers don’t come back online. Since the illegal weapons are powerful enough to destroy the solar radiation-blocking shields that surround the City, Marth begs Glory to call off her coup so citizens don’t resort to wiping themselves out to be free of the Exploit. Glory, certain that @At can survive the bombings, severely injures Marth and continues. Jo damages a projector, preventing Glory from being able to manifest physically to make it difficult for her to command the military. Meanwhile, An’s rebel group and members of the CEPD fight the military to protect the screen generators while the digital @At prevent Glory from launching a cyberattack. Marth reveals that he used the money he made from selling Switchoff to hire the remainders of the Cloud Kratocracy as a contingency plan since he suspected Glory to be planning something.\n", "Jo goes to fight off the Kratocracy fleet. The Widening Chasm, a City spaceship, is shooting at the City, so she damages and enters it. She meets with the captain, Marth’s sister Minec. Jo asks CanHaz to broadcast their conversion to the surrounding ships, then criticizes Minec for her willingness to follow Glory’s orders. Minec responds that she’s only acting logically, as the situation of the City is completely out of control. Jo states that the City’s problem isn’t rooted in emotion, but rather the distribution of power, and fighting for order rather than justice isn’t making the world a better place. Minec, agreeing with Jo, declares a ceasefire. \n", "The servers come back online allowing voting to be completed; the referendum passes with a clear majority in favor of ending the Exploit, and the Council honors the result. Glory is imprisoned and awaiting trial for treason while Stump is forced out of the Council. Marth, being the only council member left, has his resignation postponed. New councilors will be elected within three months. Plans for the gradual transition off of the Exploit are being made. Jo and Syzn (the latter trying Switchoff for the first time) have a picnic together. When Jo returns to her apartment, CanHaz gives her a letter from her father back on Earth. Jo reminisces on her time in the City, realizing how much she loves it and wonders what her next six months assigned there will be like. The story concludes with her reciting the Green Lantern Oath.\n", "\n", "This ", "–related article is a ", ". You can help Wikipedia by ", "."]},
